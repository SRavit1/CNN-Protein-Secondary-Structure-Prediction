# CNN Protein Secondary Structure Prediction

This project uses 1-D Conv Net to predict the secondary structure of a protein, given its primary structure (order of amino acids). The data used is a public dataset containing primary sequences and their corresponding secondary sequence, used for training.

The file containing data is called "ModifiedSSData1". The machine learning program is called "Protein Structure Prediction - CNN". Please feel free to try it out and build upon it!
